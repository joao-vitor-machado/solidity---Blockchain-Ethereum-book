Greetings!

A while ago I was reading a book called "Blockchain Ethereum" from Jo√£o Kuntz. It was an awesome book which tought me a lot about Blockchain and Ethereum, specificaly. In this book some Solidity code is created to teach how the lenguage works and how you can use it to create applications adapted to certain use cases. So, as the eager student I'm about Blockchain, I couldn't skip the chance to try it by mylsef. Here you have three use cases:

- A generic ERC20 token use case;
- A contract customers to exchange their points for real products;
- A contract for students enrollment in a particular course;
- A generic ERC721 token;

All these contracts have been implemented and were later on tested. To try them yourself:

- use "npm install" to install the project;
- use "ganache" to start the ganache blockchain simulator;
- use "npm run-all-tests" to see the execution for each test I implemented.

I hope you enjoy my little learning project!
